## Overview

The Snowplow Tracking CLI is a native app to make it easy to send an event to Snowplow from the command line. Use this to embed Snowplow tracking into your shell scripts and terminal sessions.

## Installing

You can download the binary for Linux, Windows, and macOS directly from Github:

* [**Linux AMD 64bit Binary**][linux-amd64-binary]
* [**Windows AMD 64bit Binary**][windows-amd64-binary]
* [**macOS AMD 64bit Binary**][darwin-amd64-binary]
* [**macOS ARM 64bit Binary**][darwin-arm64-binary]

There is also a Docker Container available at: https://hub.docker.com/r/snowplow/snowplow-tracking-cli

```bash
docker run snowplow/snowplow-tracking-cli:latest --collector={{COLLECTOR_DOMAIN}} --appid={{APP_ID}} --method=[POST|GET] --sdjson={{SELF_DESC_JSON}}
```

## Usage

The command line interface is as follows:

```bash
snowplow-tracking-cli --collector={{COLLECTOR_DOMAIN}} --appid={{APP_ID}} --method=[POST|GET] --sdjson={{SELF_DESC_JSON}}
```

or:

```bash
snowplow-tracking-cli --collector={{COLLECTOR_DOMAIN}} --appid={{APP_ID}} --method=[POST|GET] --schema={{SCHEMA_URI}} --json={{JSON}}
```

where:

* `--collector` is the domain for your Snowplow collector, e.g. `snowplow-collector.acme.com`
* `--appid` is optional (not sent if not set)
* `--method` is optional. It defaults to `GET`
* `--protocol` is optional. It defaults to `https`
* `--sdjson` is a self-describing JSON of the standard form `{ "schema": "iglu:...", "data": { ... } }`
* `--schema` is a schema URI, most likely of the form `iglu:...`
* `--json` is a (non-self-describing) JSON, of the form `{ ... }`
* `--ipaddress` is optional. It defaults to an empty string
* `--contexts` is optional. It defaults to an empty JSON array `[]`

The idea here is that you can either send in a [**self-describing JSON**][sd-json], or pass in the constituent parts (i.e. a regular JSON plus a schema URI) and the Snowplow Tracking CLI will construct the final self-describing JSON for you.

## Examples

```bash
snowplow-tracking-cli --collector snowplow-collector.acme.com --appid myappid --method POST --schema iglu:com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow/event/jsonschema/1-0-0 --json "{\"hello\":\"world\"}"
```

```bash
snowplow-tracking-cli --collector snowplow-collector.acme.com --appid myappid --method POST --sdjson "{\"schema\":\"iglu:com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow/event/jsonschema/1-0-0\", \"data\":{\"hello\":\"world\"}}"
```

## Maintainer Quick start

Assuming git is installed:

```bash
 host> git clone https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-tracking-cli
 host> cd snowplow-tracking-cli
 host> make test
 host> make
```

To remove all build files:

```bash
 host> make clean
```

To format the golang code in the source directory:

```bash
 host> make format
```

**Note:** Always run `make format` before submitting any code.

**Note:** The `make test` command also generates a code coverage file which can be found at `build/coverage/coverage.html`.

## Under the hood

There is no buffering in the Snowplow Tracking CLI - each event is sent as an individual payload whether `GET` or `POST`.

Under the hood, the app uses the [**Snowplow Golang Tracker**][golang-tracker].

The Snowplow Tracking CLI will exit once the Snowplow collector has responded. The return codes from `snowplow-tracking-cli` are as follows:

* 0 if the Snowplow collector responded with an OK status (2xx or 3xx)
* 4 if the Snowplow collector responded with a 4xx status
* 5 if the Snowplow collector responded with a 5xx status
* 1 for any other error

## Building

Add snowplow-tracking-cli and its package dependencies to your go src directory:

```
$ go get -v github.com/snowplow/snowplow-tracking-cli
```

Once the get completes, you should find your new `snowplow-tracking-cli` executable sitting inside `$GOPATH/bin/`.

To update snowplow-tracking-cli dependencies, use `go get` with the `-u` option.

```
$ go get -u -v github.com/snowplow/snowplow-tracking-cli
```
